### important points to remember

- presentation:'modal' means specific screen should be loaded as a modal.

- backgroundColor:'transparent' means no background color should be applied.

- we cannot make effect function in useEffect as async function.

### User Authentication (Sign Up & Sign In) with Firebase

- Authentication means verifing user credentials on backend.

- How Does Authentication works ?

- once the user fills form, credentials (email,password) will be sent to backend api through http request.

- on the backend, credentails are get validated and if validated successfully, backend will generate an authentication token (string with bunch of text) and sends it to mobile app.

- An authentication token will be generated by backend and as well as it is also validated by backend itself.

- once we got the auth token, it means that credentials are validated successfully on backend.

- This authentication token will be required and attached to every http request header which will be sent
to protected/secure api endpoint.

- When working with firebase and with authentication feature, we have two options :
* firebase SDK (third-party-package)
* Firebase Authentication REST API

- firebase rest api is preferred because when we create our own rest api we can follow similar approach of sending http requests.
